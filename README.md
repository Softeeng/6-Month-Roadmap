## 🚀 What I'm Working on
I'm currently in the early stages of both roadmaps, building foundational skills while keeping my eyes on the bigger picture. My goal is to create a portfolio that showcases not just technical ability, but also creativity, attention to user expereince, and awareness of real-world constraints like security and privacy.

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy
I'm a strong believer in parallel learning paths. By tackling game development alongside healthcare IT, I'm developing both creative problem-solving skills and the discipline required for mission-criticl applications. Games teach me about user engagement and polish, whie healthcare projects teach me about data integrity and compliance.
